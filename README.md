# SDN-Aegis-Integration
SDN-Aegis-Integration is a Rust-first, safety-critical SDN–IoT gateway that fuses anomaly-aware AVA-MA analysis with AU.ET/CSP energy ledgers and ICNIRP/IEC-aligned safety envelopes, enforcing non-minting, bounded-risk flows for neuromorphic, BCI, and smart-city cybernetic infrastructure. ​
